### Hi there <a href="https://jjpeleato.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="4%"></a>

My name is Jos√© J. Peleato Pradel. I am a Full-stack Developer with 10+ years of experience in developing websites and applications.

I enjoy being part of teams that tackle difficult and interesting problems. I prefer working in programming, and I feel comfortable developing both on the back end and the front end. My main skills are PHP and JavaScript.

In my professional career, I focus on writing clean, scalable and maintainable code. I'm a perfectionist, always striving to prevent potential bugs and deliver highly optimized, fast-performing solutions.
